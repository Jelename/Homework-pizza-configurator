# Pizza-configurator

This app was created using React and Redux with Controlled Forms.

Using forms we created a pizza configurator, where user can choose between lots of options. User can choose what kind of pizza base he wants, he can pick a souce of his choice and also add max. three toppings. For every pizza ingredient he will see a price and always keep track of the total pizza price.

Every step can be changed, so if user pick one kind of pizza base, he can change it any time and new price is going to be calculated.
